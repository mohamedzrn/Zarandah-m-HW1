moh: i am from Qatar and as a part of my hobbie i like to go on a drive around the city as i see the sceneries that london offers to us as it being called The Forest City. i also like to camp with my friends and have a big enough campfire for all of us to fit in and have snacks, drinks, and food ready to be cooked with the campfire.
